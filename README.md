## Question 1

What will the code below print?

```swift
var myNum = 8

for number in 4..<8{
if number == 7 {
break
} else {
myNum += number
}
}

print(myNum)
```
23

***
## Question 2

Which of the following loops will print out all the numbers between 1 and 100, inclusive?  Select all that apply.

a)
```swift
for i in 1..<100 {
print(i)
}
```

B)
```swift
for j in 1...100 {
print(j)
}
```

C)
```swift
for k in 1..<1000 where k < 101 {
print(k)
}
```

D)
```swift
for l in 1...100 where _ < 101 {
print(l)
}
```
A, B, and C
***
## Question 3

How many times will the code below print **"Nesting!"** ?

```swift
for _ in 1...10{
for _ in 1...10{
print("Nesting!")
}
}
```
100 because it runs 10 times within each loop.
***
## Question 4

Which of the loops below will run forever? Select all that apply.

a)
```swift
var q = 0

while q%2 != 1 {
print("Hello Problem Two!")
q += 2
}
```

b)
```swift
var r = 0

while r < 10 {
print("Hi there!")
r += 11
}
```

c)
```swift
var s = 0

while 3 != 3 {
print("Howdy!")
s += 1
}
```

d)
```swift
var t = 0

while t == t{
print("Ahoy-hoy!")
t += 1
}
```
A and D will loop forever
